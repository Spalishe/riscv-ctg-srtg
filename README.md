# riscv-ctg-srtg
RISC-V CTG Self-Running Test Generator

Its main purpose of converting tests, generated by [riscv-ctg](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-ctg)(now part of [riscv-arch-tests](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test)) to self running tests, which not requires signatures. It works like [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests).

The main feature in developement of this thing is that it independent from original tests architecture(atleast for now)
Right now it only supports RVI
